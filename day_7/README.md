### Joins
```css
- JOIN us an SQL keyword used to combine matched rows form two or more tables based on a related column between them.
- It allows you to create a list of combined rows of matching data from different tables
- Inner joins, the most frequently used, it returns any rows where there is a matched key in both.
- Left going or left outer join, return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table regardless of any matching entry in the right table.
- Right join or right outer join, return all rows from the right table and the a matched rows from the left table regardless of any matching entry in the table.
- Full JOIN OR FULL OUTER JOIN, returns all rows in both tables regardless of any match. Where no match exists, the missing side will contain NULL.
```
