# Day 9

### Origins of Agile:
```css
- Software developers in the 80s & 90s experienced high levels of failed projects and noticed some common traits:
- Too much analysis upfront
- Restrictive change control
- Too much uncertainty

- Software developers collaborated & experimented with new ways of working.
- They took the successful ideas & wrote down a set of underlying values and principles.
```

### The Agile Manifesto; 4 values supported by 12 principles:
```ruby
- Individuals & Interactions (Over processes & tools). Stand-ups, face to face conversations.
- Working software (Over a comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration (Over contract negotiation).
- Responding to change (Over following a plan).
```

### The  12 Principles of Agile Software:
```css
1.  Our highest priority is to statist the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximising the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
```

### Scrum Values:
```ruby
- Courage: Scrum team members have courage to do the right thing and wire on tying problems
- Focus:  
```

### Three Pillars of Empiricism:
```css
- Empiricism means working in a  experience and evidence based manner or so progress is based on reality
Transparency:
- Everyone presents the facts as is and collectively collaborates for the common organisational object. No one has a hidden agenda.
Inspection:
- Inspection is not done by an inspector but by everyone on the Scrum Team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practises.
Adaptation:
- Adaptation is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve.
```
### Roles:
```ruby
Products Owner:
- Key stakeholder who should have deep understanding of the product and communicates with both the year and other stakeholders.
Scrum Master:
- Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilitates meetings and Reeves impediments.
Scrum Team:
- Effectively 3-9 people
- All doing whatever it takes to complete the agreed tasks
- Everyone is not just committed, they are all involved.
```

### Scrum Artefact:
```css
Products backlog:
- Contains all of the stories to be done to compete the entire product.
Sprint Backlog:
- Contains only the stories to be worked on in the current Sprint.
Increment:
- A piece of working software created in a sprint. The sum of all increments forms the whole product.
```

### Information radiators:
```ruby
Task board:
- Used to track the work visually, showing the state of the sprint for both the team and other stakeholders
Burn up chart:
- Used to track team velocity, showing work completed vs time
Burn down chart:
- Used to track team velocity, showing work remaining vs time
Definition of done:
- Shared agreement of what constitutes as ‘done’ for any story
```

### The Agenda:
```css
- Set the Stage
- Gather Data
- Generate insights
- Decided what to do
- Close the retro
```
